This project was done in its entirely by Nicholas Sobrilsky and Seong Wang.
We hereby state that we have not received unauthorized help of any form.

We have included a makefile for ease of compilation and testing.
The commands are:
"make prog," which compiles both the server and the client
"make ser," which executes the server listening on port 1459
"make cli," which executes the client connecting to cf0.cs.uga.edu on port 1459
and "make clean," which deletes the compiled server and client

This code has been tested exclusively on Nike.
