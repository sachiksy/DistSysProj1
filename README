Simple FTP Server and Client: Project 1 for Distributed Systems

Added an echo server and echo client. Echo server now runs on a thread.
Server and client both loop properly. exit, pwd, and ls work (maybe need an ignore case function?).
Stubs catch all other functions. User input tokenized on two character pointers named "command" and "cargs."

To do:
1). Implement cd
2). Implement delete
3). Implement mkdir
4). Implement get
5). Implement put
6). Maybe implement data socket for get and put?
