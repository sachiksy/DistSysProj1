Simple FTP Server and Client: Project 1 for Distributed Systems

Added an echo server and echo client. Echo server now runs on a thread.
Server and client both loop properly. exit and pwd work (maybe need an ignore case function?).
Stubs catch all other functions.

To do:
1). Tokenize user input in void* echo function for args to cd, get, put, delete, mkdir. strtok() should work.
2). Implement ls (commented-out code has been inserted but neither tested nor refined)
3). Implement cd
4). Implement delete
5). Implement mkdir
6). Implement get
7). Implement put
8). Maybe implement data socket for get and put?
