Simple FTP Server and Client: Project 1 for Distributed Systems

Added an echo server and echo client. Echo server now runs on a thread.
Server and client both loop properly. exit and pwd work (maybe need an ignore case function?).
Stubs catch all other functions.

To do:
1). Implement cd
2). Implement delete
3). Implement get
4). Implement put
5). Implement data socket for get and put
6). Change socket method from IP address to hostname
